---

## **Permission Justification:**

TrustCard requires the READ_MEDIA_IMAGES permission for essential identity verification functionality. Our app needs frequent access to photos and videos for the following core features:

**Identity Document Verification:**
Users must upload government-issued ID documents (driver's license, passport, national ID) to create verified digital identities. This requires direct access to photo library to select and upload high-quality document images for verification purposes.

**Profile Photo Management:**
Users create digital profiles with profile photos that are shared via QR codes. The app needs to access existing photos from the user's gallery to set profile pictures, update profile images, and manage visual identity components.

**QR Code Generation and Sharing:**
The app generates QR codes containing user identity information and profile photos. Users need to access their photo library to attach additional images to their digital identity cards, such as business photos, event photos, or other relevant visual content.

**Contact Integration:**
When sharing digital identities with contacts, users may attach photos from their gallery to personalize their digital business cards or identity profiles.

**Security and Verification:**
The app performs image analysis and verification on uploaded documents to ensure authenticity and prevent fraud. This requires direct access to image files for processing and verification algorithms.

**User Experience:**
Frequent access is necessary because users regularly update their profiles, upload new documents, and share visual content as part of their digital identity management workflow.

The permission is essential for the app's core functionality of creating, managing, and sharing secure digital identities with visual components. Without this permission, users cannot upload identity documents or manage profile photos, which are fundamental features of the TrustCard app.
