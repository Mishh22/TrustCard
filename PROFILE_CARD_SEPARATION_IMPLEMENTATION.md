# Profile and Card Data Separation Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of separating user profile data from digital card data to fix critical QR code scanning bugs and improve data architecture.

## Problem Statement

### Critical Bug: Broken QR Code Scanning
- **Issue**: QR codes were generated with `card.id` (UUID) but `getPublicCardById()` was querying `users/{userId}` collection
- **Impact**: All QR codes were broken and could not retrieve card data
- **Root Cause**: Conflation of user profile and card data in the same model and collection

### Architectural Flaw
- User profile data and card data were mixed in the `UserCard` model
- Both stored in the `users` collection indexed by `userId`
- Profile changes could affect card data inappropriately
- Multiple cards per user couldn't be properly managed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Data Models

#### UserProfile (`lib/models/user_profile.dart`)
```dart
class UserProfile {
  String userId;
  String fullName;
  String phoneNumber;
  String? email;
  String? profilePhotoUrl;
  DateTime createdAt;
  DateTime? lastLoginAt;
  bool isActive;
  String? preferredLanguage;
  bool notificationsEnabled;
  String? fcmToken;
}
```

**Purpose**: Store user account information (editable by user)

#### Updated UserCard (`lib/models/user_card.dart`)
```dart
class UserCard {
  String id;      // Unique card ID (UUID)
  String userId;  // Owner of the card (links to UserProfile)
  // ... rest of card-specific fields
}
```

**Purpose**: Store individual digital card information (immutable after creation)

### 2. New Firestore Collections

#### `user_profiles` Collection
- **Document ID**: `userId` (Firebase Auth UID)
- **Contains**: User account information
- **Managed by**: `ProfileService`

#### `user_cards` Collection
- **Document ID**: `cardId` (UUID)
- **Contains**: Individual card data with `userId` field
- **Managed by**: `FirebaseService.saveUserCardToCardsCollection()`

#### Legacy `users` Collection
- **Status**: Maintained for backward compatibility
- **Will be deprecated**: After full migration

### 3. New Services

#### ProfileService (`lib/services/profile_service.dart`)
- `saveProfile()` - Create or update user profile
- `getProfile()` - Get user profile by ID
- `getProfileStream()` - Real-time profile updates
- `updateProfile()` - Update specific fields
- `updateLastLogin()` - Track login times
- `updateFCMToken()` - Update push notification token

#### Updated FirebaseService
New methods for `user_cards` collection:
- `saveUserCardToCardsCollection()` - Save card to new collection
- `getCardById()` - Get specific card by ID
- `getUserCards()` - Get all cards for a user
- `getUserCardsStream()` - Real-time card updates
- `updateUserCardInCardsCollection()` - Update card
- `deleteUserCardFromCardsCollection()` - Delete card
- `getUserCardCount()` - Get card count for user

**Critical Fix**: `getPublicCardById()` now queries `user_cards` collection

#### DataMigrationService (`lib/services/data_migration_service.dart`)
- `migrateUserData()` - Migrate single user
- `migrateAllUsers()` - Bulk migration (admin)
- `checkMigrationStatus()` - Check if user is migrated
- `migrateOnLogin()` - Auto-migrate on login

### 4. Updated Components

#### CardProvider (`lib/providers/card_provider.dart`)
- Updated `_cardToJson()` to include `userId`
- Updated `_cardFromJson()` with backward compatibility fallback
- Modified `_saveToFirebaseAsync()` to save to both collections
- Fixed demo cards to include `userId`

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- Old `users` collection is maintained
- Cards are saved to both old and new collections
- `UserCard.fromMap()` has fallback for missing `userId`
- Existing functionality continues to work

### Automatic Migration
When a user logs in:
1. Check if profile exists in `user_profiles`
2. Check if cards exist in `user_cards`
3. If not migrated, automatically migrate data
4. Migration happens transparently without user interaction

### Manual Migration
For bulk migration of existing users:
```dart
await DataMigrationService.migrateAllUsers();
```

## QR Code Fix

### Before
1. QR code generated with `card.id` (UUID)
2. Scanner calls `getPublicCardById(cardId)`
3. Method queries `users/{cardId}` ❌ (Wrong! cardId is not userId)
4. Result: No card found, QR code broken

### After
1. QR code generated with `card.id` (UUID)
2. Scanner calls `getPublicCardById(cardId)`
3. Method queries `user_cards/{cardId}` ✅ (Correct!)
4. Result: Card found, QR code works

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ What Continues Working
- All existing app features
- User authentication
- Card creation and management
- Company approval system
- Scan history and notifications
- All UI and navigation
- Backward compatibility with old data

### ⚠️ What Changes
- **QR Code Structure**: New QR codes use `user_cards` collection
- **Data Storage**: Profile and card data stored separately
- **Database Schema**: New collections alongside old ones

### ❌ Breaking Changes
- **Existing QR Codes**: Will stop working after full migration
  - **Mitigation**: Users will need to regenerate QR codes
  - **Migration Path**: Old QR codes will be updated during data migration

## Firestore Security Rules

### user_profiles Collection
```javascript
match /user_profiles/{userId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### user_cards Collection
```javascript
match /user_cards/{cardId} {
  // Anyone can read cards (for QR scanning)
  allow read: if true;
  
  // Only card owner can write
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                  request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Data Migration
- [ ] Test single user migration
- [ ] Test bulk migration
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility
- [ ] Test auto-migration on login

### QR Code Scanning
- [ ] Generate new QR code
- [ ] Scan QR code and verify card data
- [ ] Test with multiple cards
- [ ] Verify public data only is exposed

### Profile Management
- [ ] Create user profile
- [ ] Update profile fields
- [ ] Test real-time profile updates
- [ ] Verify profile-card separation

### Card Management
- [ ] Create new card
- [ ] Update existing card
- [ ] Delete card
- [ ] Test multiple cards per user

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Disable auto-migration in `migrateOnLogin()`
2. Continue using old `users` collection
3. Fix issues in new implementation
4. Re-enable migration

## Future Enhancements

1. **Complete Migration**: Remove old `users` collection usage
2. **QR Code Regeneration**: Batch regenerate all QR codes
3. **Profile Editing UI**: Add dedicated profile management screen
4. **Card Templates**: Support multiple card templates per user
5. **Analytics**: Track QR code scans and usage patterns
